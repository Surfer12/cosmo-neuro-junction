# Iteration Tools

This directory contains tools that support iterative processes throughout the project. The name reflects the `ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT_TAG` from the project's core framework, emphasizing the recursive, evolving nature of the work rather than simply providing static utility scripts.

## Structure

- `setup/`: Tools for environment preparation and configuration
- `validation/`: Tools for testing, verification, and quality assurance
- `processing/`: Tools for data processing, transformation, and analysis

## Tool Application

When using or creating iteration tools:

1. Design for recursive application - tools should support multiple cycles of refinement
2. Include clear documentation on input requirements and output formats
3. Consider how the tool supports awareness across scales (micro, meso, macro, meta)
4. Where possible, parametrize tools to work with both cosmological and neuroscientific contexts

## Implementation Principles

1. **Recursive Understanding**: Tools should support deepening understanding through successive iterations
2. **Context Integration**: Tools should maintain contextual awareness while processing specific details
3. **Transformative Integration**: Tools should facilitate paradigm shifts when deeper patterns emerge

These tools embody the project's commitment to iterative refinement, allowing understanding to evolve through successive layers of insight.
