# Data Fields

This directory stores datasets conceptualized as "fields" of raw material for integration, reflecting the field concept present in both cosmology (field theories) and neuroscience (neural fields). This naming embeds the project context directly into the data organization.

## Structure

- `cosmology/`: Datasets related to cosmological observations, simulations, and models
- `neuroscience/`: Datasets related to neural activity, memory studies, and cognitive processes

## Data Sources and Usage

Data in these fields should include documentation about:

1. Source and provenance
2. Data collection methodologies
3. Preprocessing steps applied
4. Ethical considerations (particularly important for neuroscience data)
5. Potential isomorphisms with data from the complementary field

## Field Interaction

When working with these data fields:

1. Consider how patterns in one field might correspond to patterns in the other
2. Apply dimensional reduction techniques consistently across domains when appropriate
3. Document cross-field insights in the relevant layer's `insights/` directory
4. Maintain awareness of the different scales represented in each dataset

These fields support data-driven integration, which is crucial for establishing evidence-based epistemological junctions between domains.
