# Cosmo-Neuro Junction

## Meta-Awareness Anchor

An epistemological junction bridging cosmology and cognitive neuroscience through fractal processing frameworks and transformative integration.

## Fractal Map of the Directory

This project is organized according to self-similar patterns that repeat across scales, reflecting the fractal nature of both cognitive processes and cosmological structures. The organization supports recursive exploration and iterative refinement.

### Core Layers

- **Root**: Meta-process awareness level, providing overview and integration principles
  - `JUNCTION_MANIFEST.md`: Core integration principles and isomorphic structures
  - `.git`, `.github`, `.goose`: System configurations supporting version control and workflow

- **junction_layers/**: Represents the layered integration of domains (micro, meso, macro, meta levels)
  - `bauman-oates/`: A meso-scale layer for specific integration narratives
  - `grok-mem/`: A micro-to-meso scale layer focusing on memory systems

- **shared_patterns/**: Reusable components reflecting self-similar patterns across layers
  - `common-utils/`: Utilities applicable across domains
  - `therapeutic-framework/`: Shared therapeutic models and frameworks

- **knowledge_web/**: A networked approach to documentation, supporting synthesis
  - `nodes/`: Core concepts from both domains
  - `connections/`: Integration points between domains
  - `methods/`: Methodologies for junction creation
  - `references/`: Academic sources and external resources

- **data_fields/**: Datasets as fields of raw material for integration
  - `cosmology/`: Cosmic datasets and observations
  - `neuroscience/`: Neural or memory data

- **iteration_tools/**: Supporting recursive refinement processes
  - `setup/`: Environment preparation scripts
  - `validation/`: Testing and verification tools
  - `processing/`: Data processing workflows

- **emergent_spaces/**: Areas for transformative exploration
  - `examples/`: Demonstrations of integrated concepts
  - `experiments/`: Exploratory implementations

## Navigating the Junction

This structure is designed as a living system that evolves with the project. Each directory contains its own README.md explaining its purpose and relation to the whole. When exploring:

1. Start with `JUNCTION_MANIFEST.md` to understand core integration principles
2. Visit `junction_layers/` to explore specific integration cases
3. Reference `knowledge_web/` to understand conceptual foundations
4. Use `shared_patterns/` to identify reusable components
5. Experiment in `emergent_spaces/` with new ideas

Remember that the structure embodies the principle of *attentional flexibility* - the ability to zoom in on specific details while maintaining awareness of the broader context.
