# Shared Patterns

This directory houses reusable components that reflect self-similar patterns across different layers of the project. Unlike conventional code packages, these are conceptualized as patterns that can be applied in various contexts throughout the junction between cosmology and neuroscience.

## Structure

- `common-utils/`: Utilities and functions applicable across domains, supporting both cosmology and neuroscience applications
- `therapeutic-framework/`: Shared therapeutic models and frameworks that provide conceptual tools for integration

## Pattern Application

When using these shared patterns:

1. Consider the scale at which you're applying the pattern (micro, meso, macro, meta)
2. Maintain awareness of how the pattern might manifest differently in cosmological vs. neuroscientific contexts
3. Document new insights about the pattern's application in the respective layer's `insights/` directory
4. If you identify a new shared pattern, consider adding it to this directory with appropriate documentation

These patterns support the `CONTEXT_INTEGRATION_TAG` concept from the project's core framework, enabling integration across different contexts while maintaining coherence.
