# Cosmology: Fundamental Concepts

## Core Definition

Cosmology is the scientific study of the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe as a whole. It investigates the fundamental laws that govern cosmic phenomena at the largest scales, from the earliest moments after the Big Bang to the present day expansion of the universe and into its potential future states.

## Key Principles

### 1. Cosmic Expansion

The universe is expanding, as evidenced by the redshift of distant galaxies. This expansion appears to be accelerating, suggesting the presence of dark energy as a driving force. The expansion rate is characterized by the Hubble constant (H₀).

### 2. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

The CMB is thermal radiation left over from the early universe, specifically from the epoch of recombination approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. It provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and offers a snapshot of the early universe's density fluctuations.

### 3. Structure Formation

Cosmic structure formation describes how small initial density fluctuations in the early universe underwent gravitational collapse over billions of years to form the complex cosmic web of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters observed today. This self-organization process is driven by fundamental physical forces, particularly gravity.

### 4. Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that accounts for approximately 85% of the universe's mass. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force but would still have gravitational effects on ordinary matter. Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and accelerates the universe's expansion.

### 5. General Relativity

Einstein's theory of general relativity forms the mathematical foundation of modern cosmology, describing gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It provides the framework for understanding cosmic dynamics at large scales.

## Methodological Approaches

1. **Observational Cosmology**: Uses telescopes and detectors to gather data about distant cosmic objects and phenomena.
2. **Theoretical Cosmology**: Develops mathematical models and simulations to explain cosmic structure and evolution.
3. **Physical Cosmology**: Applies fundamental physics (especially general relativity and quantum field theory) to understand the universe's behavior.
4. **Computational Cosmology**: Employs supercomputers to simulate complex cosmic processes like galaxy formation and dark matter distribution.

## Dimensional Considerations

Cosmological phenomena operate across vast spatial and temporal scales:
- **Spatial**: From subatomic particles to the observable universe (approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter)
- **Temporal**: From Planck time (10⁻⁴³ seconds after the Big Bang) to the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years)

## Ontological Status

Cosmology deals with entities that exist at scales far beyond direct human experience, often requiring indirect inference and mathematical modeling. The ontological status of cosmic entities (especially dark matter and dark energy) remains an active area of philosophical and scientific inquiry.

## Connections to Other Domains

- **Physics**: Relies on fundamental physics, especially quantum mechanics and general relativity
- **Mathematics**: Uses advanced mathematical tools for modeling cosmic phenomena
- **Philosophy**: Raises questions about the nature of reality, causality, and the limits of knowledge
- **Neuroscience**: Potential isomorphisms in pattern formation, field theories, and complexity (see the Connections section of the Knowledge Web)
