# Knowledge Web

Unlike conventional documentation which is often linear and hierarchical, the Knowledge Web represents a networked, non-linear approach to organizing the project's knowledge. It reflects the interconnected nature of ideas across cosmology and neuroscience domains.

## Structure

- `nodes/`: Core concepts from both domains (cosmology basics, neuroscience principles)
- `connections/`: Integration points between domains (isomorphic mappings, conceptual bridges)
- `methods/`: Methodologies for junction creation and exploration
- `references/`: Academic sources and external resources

## Navigation

The web is designed to be explored from multiple entry points, depending on your perspective or question:

1. Start from `nodes/` if you're seeking understanding of fundamental concepts
2. Explore `connections/` if you're interested in how concepts relate across domains
3. Consult `methods/` when you want to understand or apply specific approaches
4. Reference `references/` for academic grounding and further exploration

## Contributing

When adding to the Knowledge Web:

1. Consider how new content connects to existing nodes
2. Create explicit connection documents when identifying links between concepts
3. Maintain awareness of the fractal nature of knowledge - each node can be expanded into its own web
4. Use metadata tags to facilitate cross-referencing

This structure aligns with the `META_AWARENESS_TAG` from the project's core framework, supporting pattern recognition across scales and domains.
