Initial Assessment:
The user's query to "rename all files according to content and context" is a complex task, as it requires analyzing file contents for thematic patterns, integrating contextual knowledge from the workspace (e.g., educational and fractal themes), and applying precise renaming to avoid errors; this classification is justified by the need for semantic interpretation and potential for unintended disruptions.
Fractal Framework Application:
a) Initial State (z₀): The core concept involves renaming files in the "campus-ambas" directory based on their internal content and broader context, such as research on fractal methodologies.
b) Recursive Elaboration (z₀²): This reveals patterns where file names like "<fractal_analysis>.-2md" and "I'll implement the fractal methodology f" may not accurately reflect their content, potentially leading to cognitive misalignment in research workflows; elaborating further, unrefined names could obscure meta-analytical insights, necessitating a recursive review to align names with emergent themes.
c) Complementary Input (c): Drawing from &integration (meaning construction) and &attentional_flexibility (dynamic focus allocation), I introduce a therapeutic perspective that emphasizes synthesizing file content with contextual cues (e.g., directory themes) to create meaningful, adaptive names, disrupting disorganized patterns.
d) Synthesize New State (z₁): Combining the elaborated naming issues with this input forms a strategy to first read files for accurate content analysis, then propose contextually informed renames, ensuring the process evolves with precision.
e) Further Iteration (Beginning New Cycle): To address potential ambiguities, continue:
z₁²: This highlights risks like misinterpretation of content or file conflicts, underscoring the importance of iterative verification.
c₂: Introduce &grounding (present awareness) to anchor decisions in the current shell and workspace state.
z₂: Synthesize by prioritizing tool-based file reading before renaming, creating a refined, multi-scale approach.
Therapeutic Integration:
Incorporate &meta_awareness for ongoing pattern recognition and &transformation to disrupt suboptimal naming, while weaving in &iterative_refinement to evolve the process across cognitive scales.
Multi-Scale Analysis:
Micro: Individual files' content (e.g., lines in "<fractal_analysis>.-2md") must be examined for key themes to inform specific name changes.
Meso: Patterns across files, such as shared fractal or educational motifs, suggest thematic renaming for cohesive grouping.
Macro: The directory as a whole benefits from names that enhance navigability, supporting broader research integration.
Meta: Awareness of the renaming process itself ensures adaptability, preventing errors through recursive feedback.
Meta-Analysis:
This analysis demonstrates the framework's self-similarity, where initial queries lead to layered refinements, with &attentional_flexibility enabling dynamic tool use for optimal outcomes.

<response>
<micro>
At the micro level, each file's content—such as specific lines in "<fractal_analysis>.-2md"—will be analyzed to derive precise, descriptive names that capture core elements like fractal themes.
</micro>
<meso>
On the meso level, patterns in file contents (e.g., references to methodologies) will inform interconnected naming conventions, fostering thematic consistency within folders like "docs".
</meso>
<macro>
At the macro level, renaming files to reflect their content and context will transform the "campus-ambas" directory into a more intuitive structure, enhancing meta-analytical accessibility and cognitive alignment with research goals.
</macro>
<meta>
Reflecting on this process, the fractal framework ensures grounded, iterative progress, using &integration to balance content analysis with contextual awareness for effective transformations.

To rename files based on their content and context, I first need to read the relevant files for accurate analysis. I'll start by examining the files in the root directory.
