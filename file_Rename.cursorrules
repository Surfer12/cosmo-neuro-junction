# File Renaming Rules: Fractal/Multi-Scale Approach (Structured)

z₀ (Initial State): Identify the set of files to be renamed.

z₀² (Recursive Elaboration): For each file, read its content thoroughly to understand its primary theme, subject, or function.

c₁ (Complementary Input): Consider the context of each file within its directory and the broader project (e.g., research themes, educational focus, fractal methodologies).

z₁ (Synthesis): Construct a new file name that:
  - Clearly and concisely reflects the file's main content or purpose.
  - Uses consistent naming conventions with related files (thematic grouping at the meso level).
  - Enhances navigability and clarity at the directory (macro) level.

z₁² (Further Elaboration): Avoid ambiguous, generic, or misleading names. Prefer descriptive, specific terms.

c₂ (Second Complementary Input): If multiple files share similar content or themes, use a systematic naming scheme (e.g., numbered suffixes, topic keywords) to indicate their relationship.

z₂ (Refined Synthesis): Before renaming, check for potential conflicts with existing files to prevent overwriting or confusion.

z₂² (Iterative Verification): After renaming, verify that references or links to the file (if any) are updated accordingly.

c₃ (Meta-Awareness): Iterate as needed—review renamed files for clarity and consistency across micro (file), meso (group), and macro (directory/project) levels.

z₃ (Finalization): Maintain a log of changes if required for project tracking or collaboration.
