# Bauman-Oates Project Index

Welcome to the Bauman-Oates project. This index document serves as a central navigation hub for understanding the project's organization, components, and files.

## Project Overview

The Bauman-Oates project is a multifaceted initiative with three main components:

1. **Great White Shark Sighting Tracker**: A cross-platform system for tracking shark sightings along the Wallace, California coast.
2. **Emergency SOS for Apple Watch**: A Swift implementation for an emergency response system.
3. **Therapeutic Model**: A theoretical framework implemented in Julia exploring fractal principles for therapeutic applications.

## Configuration
- Various configuration files are located in the [config](./config/) directory
- Additional configuration for the therapeutic model is in its directory

## Timeline and Progress

Based on the documentation, the project appears to be in the planning and early implementation phases. The shark tracker has a defined 42-week timeline (culminating in February 2026), with the following phases:

1. Planning & Design (2 weeks)
2. iOS & API MVP (4 weeks)
3. Desktop MVP (6 weeks)
4. LLM Summaries (8 weeks)
5. Geofence Alerts (10 weeks)
6. QA & Launch (12 weeks)

## Integration Analysis

The most notable integration point is the placement of the Emergency SOS system within the shark-tracker directory, suggesting a planned safety integration between these components. The therapeutic model, while separate in the directory structure, offers concepts that could enhance both the shark tracker and emergency response systems, particularly in high-stress user scenarios.

For a detailed analysis of these integration points, see the [Component Analysis](./component-analysis.md) document.

## Getting Started

To understand and navigate this project:

1. First, review the [Project Organization](./project-organization.md) document for a high-level overview
2. Explore the [Component Analysis](./component-analysis.md) to understand each major component
3. Reference the [Project File Map](./project-file-map.md) to locate specific files
4. Review the architecture diagrams to understand the technical design
5. Examine implementation files for technical details

## Conclusion

The Bauman-Oates project represents an innovative approach to environmental monitoring, emergency response, and cognitive frameworks. By integrating these typically separate domains, it has the potential to create a more holistic safety and awareness system.
