# Stepwise Process Toward Completion for Bauman-Oates

## Focus: Great White Shark Sighting Tracker
Given the detailed timeline from `shark-tracker-timeline.md`, the stepwise process below focuses on this component. Parallel processes for other components will be developed as their timelines are defined.

## Step 1: Project Setup and Planning
- **Action**: Schedule kickoff meeting, assign Phase 1 tasks, set up project tracking, provision development environments, and begin wireframing.
- **Outcome**: A clear project roadmap and accessible documentation for all team members.
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks (April 16 - April 30, 2025).
- **Milestone**: Architecture & Design Documentation Approved.

## Step 2: iOS & API MVP Development
- **Action**: Develop iOS app structure with MapKit, implement API endpoints for sighting submission, and connect app to database.
- **Outcome**: Functional MVP for iOS and API, ready for internal testing.
- **Duration**: 4 weeks (May 1 - May 28, 2025).
- **Milestone**: iOS & API MVP Functional.

## Step 3: Desktop MVP Development
- **Action**: Set up Java environment, design dashboard, integrate map and API, develop reporting and authentication features.
- **Outcome**: Functional MVP for desktop application.
- **Duration**: 6 weeks (May 29 - July 9, 2025).
- **Milestone**: Desktop Application MVP Complete.

## Step 4: LLM Summaries Integration
- **Action**: Select LLM provider, integrate with backend API, design UI for summaries, and optimize performance.
- **Outcome**: Working summary generation and display features on both platforms.
- **Duration**: 8 weeks (July 10 - September 3, 2025).
- **Milestone**: LLM Summary Features Implemented.

## Step 5: Geofence Alerts Development
- **Action**: Implement geofencing and notification systems on iOS and desktop, develop alert logic, and test for accuracy and efficiency.
- **Outcome**: Functional geofence alert system integrated with sighting submissions.
- **Duration**: 10 weeks (September 4 - November 12, 2025).
- **Milestone**: Geofence Alert System Functional.

## Step 6: QA, Beta Testing, and Launch
- **Action**: Conduct internal testing, recruit beta testers in Wallace, CA, address feedback, prepare App Store submission, and finalize distribution.
- **Outcome**: Polished applications ready for public use, successfully launched.
- **Duration**: 12 weeks (November 13, 2025 - February 4, 2026).
- **Milestone**: Public Launch.

## Parallel Steps for Other Components
- **Emergency SOS Feature**: Initiate design and development phases overlapping with later shark tracker phases (e.g., during LLM Summaries or Geofence Alerts), targeting completion post-shark tracker launch.
- **Therapeutic Model**: Begin conceptual refinement and validation studies during shark tracker QA phase, with timelines to be detailed separately.

## Notes
- Each step includes checkpoints for review and potential pivots based on project needs or external feedback.
- Collaboration with stakeholders at key stages (design approval, beta testing) is critical, especially engaging the Wallace, CA community for the shark tracker.
- Risk mitigation strategies (e.g., for LLM costs, API performance) are detailed in `shark-tracker-timeline.md` and should be actively managed.
