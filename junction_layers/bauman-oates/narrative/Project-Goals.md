# Project Goals for Bauman-Oates

## Primary Objectives
1. **Great White Shark Sighting Tracker**: Develop a cross-platform application for tracking shark sightings along the Wallace, California coast, with features including map visualization, geofence alerts, and LLM-generated summaries, targeting a public launch by February 4, 2026.
2. **Emergency SOS Feature**: Create a reliable SOS system for Apple Watch users, enhancing safety through swift emergency response capabilities.
3. **Therapeutic Model Exploration**: Formalize a therapeutic model (as seen in the YAML file) that could potentially integrate with other project components or stand alone for health-related applications.

## Secondary Objectives
1. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough and clear documentation to facilitate collaboration and future development.
2. **Scalability**: Design systems that can be scaled or adapted for broader applications or different environments.
3. **User Engagement**: Ensure that end-user feedback, especially from the Wallace, CA community for the shark tracker, is integrated into iterative design and development processes.

## Success Metrics
- **Shark Tracker**:
  - User adoption rate in Wallace, CA (specific target to be set post-beta).
  - Number of sighting reports submitted.
  - Alert effectiveness (time between sighting submission and alert delivery).
  - Summary quality (user satisfaction with LLM-generated insights).
  - Cross-platform engagement (percentage of users utilizing both iOS and desktop apps).
- **SOS Feature**: Response time under a specific threshold in emergency scenarios (e.g., under 10 seconds for alert dispatch).
- **Therapeutic Model**: Validation through expert review or pilot study results indicating potential efficacy.
