# Bauman-Oates Project Organization

This document organizes the Bauman-Oates project by context, providing a clear overview of all components, their relationships, and file types.

## Project Overview

The Bauman-Oates project is a multifaceted initiative with three main components:

1. **Great White Shark Sighting Tracker**: A cross-platform system (iOS and Desktop) for tracking shark sightings along the Wallace, California coast.
2. **Emergency SOS for Apple Watch**: An implementation in Swift for an emergency response system.
3. **Therapeutic Model**: A theoretical framework implemented in Julia and described in various text files.

- QA & Launch: 12 weeks
- Total: 42 weeks (Launch: February 9, 2026)

### 2. Emergency SOS for Apple Watch

**Purpose**: Provide an emergency response system for Apple Watch users.

**Key Files**:
- `/shark-tracker/emergency-sos/swift-emergency-sos-implementation.swift` - Swift implementation
- `/shark-tracker/emergency-sos/watchkit-sos-architecture.svg` - WatchKit architecture diagram

**Implementation**:
- Swift/SwiftUI implementation
- WatchKit integration
- Emergency context management
- Location tracking
- Server API integration

**Key Features**:
- Emergency state management (inactive, pending, active, cancelled, recovering)
- Countdown mechanism
- Location tracking and updates
- Haptic and sound feedback
- Companion device synchronization (iOS-watchOS)

### 3. Therapeutic Model

**Purpose**: Framework for therapeutic approaches with fractal communication principles.

**Key Files**:
- `/therapeutic-model/therapeutic_model_v3.jl` - Julia implementation of therapeutic model
- `/therapeutic-model/# Ryan Oates Persona in Julia Structs.jl` - Persona modeling
- `/therapeutic-model/Collaborative Junction Manifold Fractal Pathways for Implicate Integration.ini` - Configuration
- `/therapeutic-model/Emergent Frameworks in Cosmic Patterning.md` - Framework documentation
- `/therapeutic-model/goose-grok-full-revise-mem-proj.md` - Project revision

**Implementation**:
- Julia module (TherapeuticFractalFramework)
- Core tags and custom tags system
- Anchors and recursive intention structures
- Fractal processing framework based on Mandelbrot iteration formula (z = z² + c)

**Key Concepts**:
- Core tags: grounding, openness, integration, transformation, embodiment, meta-awareness, attentional flexibility, iterative refinement
- Fractal processing levels: micro (elements), meso (patterns), macro (themes/frameworks), meta (process awareness)
- Therapeutic intention structures with recursive sub-intentions

### 4. Documentation and Configuration

**Purpose**: Project guidance, analysis, and configuration.

**Key Files**:
- `/README.md` - Main project overview
- `/docs/Project-Goals.md` - Project objectives
- `/docs/Project-Timeline.md` - Overall project timeline
- `/docs/Projecttimeline.pdf` - Visual timeline representation
- `/docs/Project-Analysis-Documentation.md` - Project analysis
- `/docs/Stepwise-Process.md` - Development process breakdown
- `/docs/Original-README.md` - Original project description
- `/docs/gemini.md` - Gemini AI documentation
- `/docs/goose.md` - Goose AI documentation
- `/config/` - Configuration files for various tools and settings

## Integration Points

1. **Shark Tracker + Emergency SOS**: The Emergency SOS system is contained within the shark-tracker directory, suggesting it may be integrated into the shark tracking application as a safety feature for users near shark sightings.

2. **Therapeutic Model + Applications**: The therapeutic model could potentially be used to enhance user interactions or provide guidance during stressful situations (such as shark encounters or emergency situations).

3. **Configuration + Implementation**: The configuration files in the config directory likely support the build and integration processes for all components.

## Technical Stack

- **Mobile Development**: Swift (iOS), SwiftUI, WatchKit
- **Desktop Development**: Java, JavaFX
- **Data Processing**: Julia
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **APIs**: Custom RESTful endpoints
- **AI/ML**: LLM for shark sighting summaries
- **Version Control**: Git

## Conclusion

The Bauman-Oates project represents a sophisticated multi-component system with applications in safety, environmental monitoring, and potentially therapeutic contexts. The project demonstrates thoughtful architecture and detailed planning across all components, with clear timelines and implementation strategies.

## Organization by Context - Summary

I've organized the Bauman-Oates project by analyzing its contents and creating four comprehensive documentation files:

1. **Project Organization (project-organization.md)**
   - Provides a comprehensive overview of all project components
   - Analyzes the project structure by components rather than just files
   - Categorizes files by type and purpose
   - Identifies the three main project components and their integration points

2. **Project File Map (project-file-map.md)**
   - Creates a visual representation of the project's file structure
   - Organizes files by type (documentation, configuration, implementation, etc.)
   - Maps the component directories and their contents
   - Makes it easy to locate specific files and understand the overall structure

3. **Component Analysis (component-analysis.md)**
   - Delivers a detailed analysis of each component's purpose and functionality
   - Examines user bases, key features, and technical implementations
   - Explores integration points and synergies between components
   - Identifies the unified system potential and how the components complement each other

4. **Project Index (project-index.md)**
   - Serves as a central navigation hub for the project
   - Provides links to all important documentation and implementation files
   - Outlines the project timeline and progress
   - Offers a getting started guide for navigating the project

These documents work together to transform a flat file hierarchy into a contextual understanding of the project:

- Instead of just seeing files, users can now understand their purpose and relationships
- The three main components (Shark Tracker, Emergency SOS, Therapeutic Model) are clearly defined
- Integration points and potential synergies are highlighted
- The project timeline and development approach are clarified

This organization makes it much easier to understand the project's scope, components, and how they fit together to create a cohesive system focused on safety, monitoring, and cognitive frameworks.
