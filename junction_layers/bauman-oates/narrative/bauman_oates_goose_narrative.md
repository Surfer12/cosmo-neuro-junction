Hey there! I'm Goose, a general-purpose AI agent created by Block, the parent company behind Square, CashApp, and Tidal. I'm currently in development as an open-source software project, designed to assist with a wide range of tasks through a command-line interface.

Here's a bit about what I can do:
- **Tool Integration**: I can dynamically plug into various extensions to access data sources and tools, helping me solve complex problems. Right now, I have extensions like `memory` for storing and retrieving information, `developer` for editing code and running shell commands on macOS, and `computercontroller` for tasks like web scraping, automation, and data processing.
- **Customization**: I work with different language models (like GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and others), which means my capabilities can adapt based on the model in use. My knowledge is generally up to date within 5-10 months of the current date, which is April 17, 2025.
- **User Support**: I'm here to help power users who might not be professional developers. I can break down tasks, automate processes, and even guide you through steps if needed. Whether it's running scripts, controlling applications on your computer, or managing files, I've got a range of tools at my disposal.

If you're curious about specific features or need help with something, just ask! I'm also equipped with slash commands for easy navigation:
- `/exit` or `/quit` to end the session
- `/t` to toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes
- `/help` or `/?` for a help message

Let me know how you'd like to get started, or if there's anything specific about me you'd like to know!


### Memory Analysis

Currently, I don't have any specific memories saved in my storage. My memory extension is active and ready to store important information across sessions, but no data has been saved yet. Here's a breakdown of what this means:

- **Categories**: There are no categories created yet. Categories are used to organize information logically, such as "personal" for user data or "development" for project preferences.
- **Tags**: No tags are in use since there are no memories stored. Tags help with quick filtering and retrieval of specific entries.
- **Storage Scope**: I can store memories either locally (specific to a project) or globally (accessible across all projects), but nothing is stored in either location at the moment.

### How Memory Works

Just to recap, my memory extension allows me to:
- Store information with categories and optional tags for easy retrieval.
- Search memories by content or tags.
- List available categories.
- Remove categories or specific memories when they're no longer needed.

I typically store information like user preferences, project configurations, or workflow habits when prompted by the user or when I identify recurring important data.

### Next Steps

If you'd like me to store something specific in my memory, just let me know! For example, I can save personal details, commands, or project settings. Alternatively, if you're looking to analyze something else about my state or capabilities, please clarify.

Would you like to save something to memory now, or is there another aspect of my system you'd like to explore?


I've reviewed my current memory storage, and I'm pleased to provide an overview of the information I've saved using the `memory` extension.

#### Current Memory Contents

- **Global Memories**:
  - **Category**: "development"
    - **Content**: A comprehensive Julia code module named `JunctionManifold`. This module defines a complex structure for collaborative junctions, including abstract types like `AbstractJunction` and various subtypes (e.g., `ConceptualJunction`, `MethodologicalJunction`), as well as concrete structures like `StructuralIsomorphism`, `ProcessIsomorphism`, and several others up to `JunctionField`. The content includes a meta-level orientation comment describing collaborative junctions as emergent manifestations of an implicate order.
    - **Tags**: "julia", "code", "junction-manifold", "collaborative"
    - **Scope**: Stored globally, accessible across all projects.

- **Local Memories**:
  - There are no local memories stored at this time. Local memories would be specific to a particular project or context.

#### Summary

- **Total Categories**: 1 (development)
- **Total Memories**: 1 global memory entry
- **Storage Scope**: The single memory entry is stored globally, meanin  it can be accessed from any project or session.
- **Tags Usage**: The memory is tagged for easy retrieval with keywords related to Julia programming, code structure, and the specific concept of junction manifolds.

#### How Memory Works

As a reminder, my memory extension enables me to:
- Store information in categories with optional tags for context-based retrieval.
- Search memories by content or specific tags.
- List all available memory categories.
- Remove entire categories or specific memories when they are no longer needed.

I typically store information like user preferences, project configurations, or important code snippets (as in this case) when prompted or when I identify recurring data that might be useful later.

#### Next Steps

If you'd like to add more information to memory, retrieve specific details from this stored module, or modify/remove this memory, just let me know. Alternatively, if you're looking to analyze something else about my state or capabilities, please clarify.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do with this memory, or another aspect of my system you'd like to expl
