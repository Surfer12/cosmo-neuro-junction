# Bauman-Oates Layer

This meso-scale layer focuses on specific integration narratives and case studies in the epistemological junction between cosmology and neuroscience. Named after its primary contributors, this layer explores concrete instances where cosmological and neurological principles converge.

## Structure

Following the fractal self-similar pattern of the overall project:

- `narrative/`: Documentation and storytelling about the integration cases
  - Contains: `component-analysis.md`, `project-file-map.md`, `project-index.md`, `project-organization.md`, `proposal-for-merg.md`
- `context/`: Settings and configurations grounding this layer
- `tools/`: Components and utilities specific to this layer
  - `shark-tracker/`: A specific tool or component for tracking and analyzing patterns
  - `therapeutic-model/`: Implementation of therapeutic frameworks in this context
- `insights/`: Emergent findings and iterative notes from this layer

## Integration Focus

This layer particularly examines meso-level patterns - relationships between elements, immediate contexts, and interaction sequences. It maps these patterns across both cosmological and neuroscientific domains, looking for consistent mathematical or conceptual frameworks.

Specific areas of investigation include:

1. Pattern tracking across domains (via shark-tracker)
2. Application of therapeutic models to understanding both cognitive and cosmological processes
3. Organizational principles that apply at both human and universal scales

## Related Components

This layer draws on:
- Shared patterns from `shared_patterns/therapeutic-framework/`
- Concepts documented in `knowledge_web/connections/`
- Data from both `data_fields/cosmology/` and `data_fields/neuroscience/`

Insights generated in this layer should be documented in the `insights/` directory and may inform updates to the `JUNCTION_MANIFEST.md` at the root level.
