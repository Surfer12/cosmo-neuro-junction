# Grok-Mem Layer

This micro-to-meso scale layer focuses on memory systems and neuroscience integration, with particular emphasis on the deep understanding ("grok") of memory processes and their potential isomorphisms with cosmological phenomena. The name combines "grok" (to understand profoundly) with "mem" (memory).

## Structure

Following the fractal self-similar pattern of the overall project:

- `README.md`: This overview document
- `narrative/`: Knowledge synthesis and documentation
  - Contains: `storage-goose.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README_TESTS.md`
- `context/`: Configurations grounding this layer
  - Contains: `grok-settings.jsonc`, `.env.example`, `pixi.toml`, `pom.xml`, `package-lock.json`, etc.
- `elements/`: Core building blocks (micro-scale)
  - `julia/`: Julia implementation files
    - Contains: `TherapeuticFractalFramework.jl`, `The user wants to compare the Julia code.jl`
- `patterns/`: Test scripts and pattern validation (meso-scale)
  - Contains: `run_tests.py`, `run-all-tests.sh`, `run-micro-tests.sh`, `tests.py`
- `themes/`: Synthesized outputs and higher-level structures (macro-scale)
- `timeline/`: Temporal context and development history
- `insights/`: Iterative findings, e.g., notes on model evolution
- `models/`: Conceptual frameworks and formal model definitions
  - Contains: `therapeutic-model-v3.yaml` (renamed from `## <yaml_therapeutic_model> v3.yaml`)
- `misc/`: Small or temporary files

## Integration Focus

This layer examines memory systems at multiple scales and searches for isomorphic structures between:

1. Memory formation and consolidation in neural systems
2. Information preservation and transformation in cosmological systems
3. Recursive processing in both cognition and universal evolution

The therapeutic fractal framework serves as a key conceptual tool, applying fractal principles (self-similarity across scales, sensitivity to initial conditions, iteration and refinement, edge of chaos dynamics) to understand both memory and cosmic processes.

## Computational Implementation

This layer has a significant computational component, with Julia implementations of the theoretical frameworks. The code embodies the fractal thinking at the heart of the project, with particular focus on:

1. Recursive algorithms that mirror natural processes
2. Models of state transformation in memory and cosmic systems
3. Pattern recognition across different scales and domains

## Related Components

This layer draws on:
- Shared patterns from `shared_patterns/therapeutic-framework/`
- Concepts documented in `knowledge_web/nodes/` (particularly memory and field theory nodes)
- Processing tools from `iteration_tools/processing/`

Insights generated in this layer should be documented in the `insights/` directory and may inform updates to the root `JUNCTION_MANIFEST.md`, particularly regarding isomorphisms between memory and cosmic processes.
