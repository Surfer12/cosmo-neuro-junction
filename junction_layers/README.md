# Junction Layers

This directory represents the layered integration of cosmology and neuroscience domains across micro, meso, macro, and meta scales. Each layer represents a specific area of focus or integration case study.

## Structure

Each layer follows a self-similar pattern reflecting the fractal nature of the project:

- `README.md`: Layer-specific overview
- `narrative/`: Storytelling and documentation specific to the layer
- `context/`: Settings and configurations grounding the layer
- `tools/`: Components and utilities specific to this layer
- `insights/`: Emergent findings and iterative notes

## Current Layers

### `bauman-oates/`

A meso-scale layer focused on specific integration narratives or case studies. Named after its primary contributors, this layer explores particular instances of cosmology-neuroscience integration.

### `grok-mem/`

A micro-to-meso scale layer focusing on memory systems and neuroscience integration. This layer explores the deep understanding of memory processes and their potential isomorphisms with cosmological phenomena.
